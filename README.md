# TransferRL.

# Running code
To run the code you need to install all the requirements + some linux packages (for example you need swing). I am working on a docker image. Then I use CMake but you can also run the individual files however you need to set a new python path with `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:../` (You need to include the Package files).
